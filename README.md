### What I learned

Working on this project, I gained practical experience with setting up custom fonts using the @font-face rule in CSS. I followed Kevin Powell's approach, which emphasizes simplicity and efficiency in managing web fonts. By defining multiple @font-face declarations, I could set specific font weights and fallback fonts, ensuring compatibility across different devices. This setup enhances accessibility and performance, aligning with best practices for modern web design.

```css
@font-face {
  font-family: "Outfit";
  font-weight: 400;
  src: url("/assets/fonts/static/Outfit-Regular.ttf"), format('truetype');
}
```

### Continued development

I would like to continue learning about responsive web design.
